Associated Data and Code from the Gaia Resolved Triples catalog (Shariat, El-Badry, & Naoz 2025).

The triples_catalog.csv contains the high-confidence sample where each row corresponds to one triple, and the data for the inner primary, inner secondary, and tertiary begin contain '1', '2', and '3.' 
For each star in each triple, we provide relevant Gaia columns (Gaia DR3 source id, parallax, proper motions, ra, dec, bp_rp, phot_g_mean_mag) along with other variables derived from Gaia data, including masses for main-sequence stars, R_chance_score (chance alignment probability), and star type based on CMD location (WD or MS).
